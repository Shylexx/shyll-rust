# Shyll - Rust  

A Rust implementation of the Shyll shell I created previously.  
Worth mentioning that I did use a tutorial to make the original C version of the shell, so I choseto make this more so to prove to myself some basic understanding of using Rust correctly, and to try and use my brain to make something.
